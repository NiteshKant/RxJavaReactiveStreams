# RxJava Reactive Streams

This library provides adapters between RxJava and [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org).
The Reactive Streams standard defines an API and runtime semantics for reactive data streams, that other tools can implement in order to interoperate with other tools.
This library allows RxJava to interoperate with other implementors of the Reactive Streams API.

It provides the following API:

```java
package rx;

import org.reactivestreams.Publisher;

public abstract class RxReactiveStreams {

    public static <T> Publisher<T> toPublisher(Observable<T> observable) { … }

    public static <T> Observable<T> toObservable(Publisher<T> publisher) { … }

}
```

These methods can be used to convert between the Reactive Streams `Publisher` type, and RxJava's `Observable` type.

Some [examples of this library being used for interop](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJavaReactiveStreams/tree/0.x/examples) are available as part of this repository.

See the [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org) website for links to other libraries that implement the Reactive Streams API,
and can therefore interoperate with RxJava via these methods.
